# LAB - Number 12

## Bus Mall

I'm in the process of building a market analysis app for BusMall. It surveys the customers in what product they like the most. At the end, a chart of the results and stats show up. At this point I'm customizing the chart to look decent. I also added local storage functionality to this so that the totals persist on page refresh. You can see this data in the chart.

### Reflections and Comments

* This was hard to do. Maybe a case of the monday blues but I was really foggy today especially with the while loop.

* Adding a chart was fun. Especially how I didn't have to code it out myself xD. Libraries are cool!

* Adding localStorage wasn't too difficult. Mainly just had to follow the standard steps. We went over a simple if else statement in class that worked perfectly.
